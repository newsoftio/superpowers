# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context (grounding pass 1 — recon)** — check files, docs, recent commits; survey which existing paths, subsystems, and patterns already cover this area (code-graph tooling where available, otherwise search). Recon findings must shape the approaches in step 4.
2. **Offer the visual companion just-in-time** — NOT upfront. The first time a question would genuinely be clearer shown than described, offer it then (its own message); on approval its browser tab opens for you. If no visual question ever arises, never offer it. See the Visual Companion section below.
3. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
4. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
5. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
6. **Ground the treeview (grounding pass 2)** — draft the touched-files treeview, then dispatch spec-researcher subagent(s) (see [spec-researcher-prompt.md](spec-researcher-prompt.md)) to fill the evidence contract before the spec is written
7. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/superpowers/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>/spec.md` (the arc folder — every artifact of this arc lives in that one folder) and commit
8. **Spec self-review** — quick inline check for placeholders, contradictions, ambiguity, scope, grounding (see below)
9. **User reviews written spec** — ask user to review the spec file before proceeding
10. **Transition to implementation** — invoke writing-plans skill to create implementation plan

}
```

**The terminal state is invoking writing-plans.** Do NOT invoke frontend-design, mcp-builder, or any other implementation skill. The ONLY skill you invoke after brainstorming is writing-plans.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems (e.g., "build a platform with chat, file storage, billing, and analytics"), flag this immediately. Don't spend questions refining details of a project that needs to be decomposed first.
- If the project is too large for a single spec, help the user decompose into sub-projects: what are the independent pieces, how do they relate, what order should they be built? Then brainstorm the first sub-project through the normal design flow. Each sub-project gets its own spec → plan → implementation cycle.
- For appropriately-scoped projects, ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Ask questions inline as plain prose — never the question widget. Offering lettered options (a/b/c) inside the text is fine; open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

**Design for isolation and clarity:**

- Break the system into smaller units that each have one clear purpose, communicate through well-defined interfaces, and can be understood and tested independently
- For each unit, you should be able to answer: what does it do, how do you use it, and what does it depend on?
- Can someone understand what a unit does without reading its internals? Can you change the internals without breaking consumers? If not, the boundaries need work.
- Smaller, well-bounded units are also easier for you to work with - you reason better about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. When a file grows large, that's often a signal that it's doing too much.

**Working in existing codebases:**

- Explore the current structure before proposing changes. Follow existing patterns.
- Where existing code has problems that affect the work (e.g., a file that's grown too large, unclear boundaries, tangled responsibilities), include targeted improvements as part of the design - the way a good developer improves code they're working in.
- Don't propose unrelated refactoring. Stay focused on what serves the current goal.

## After the Design

**Documentation:**

- Write the validated design (spec) to `docs/superpowers/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>/spec.md`
  - (User preferences for spec location override this default)
- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available
- Commit the design document to git

**Required Spec Sections:**

Every spec MUST contain these three sections:

1. **Touched-files treeview** — a file tree of every file the design creates, modifies, or deletes. Every entry carries the **evidence contract**, filled by the pass-2 spec-researcher subagents (never by unaided recall):
   - **Ladder tag:** `reuse` (existing path used as-is) | `extend` (existing path or generic construct extended) | `lib` (library adopted) | `new` (net-new path)
   - **Evidence:** `reuse`/`extend` — the existing path(s) cited `file:line`; `lib` — the library plus the doc/registry command used to confirm the latest version (never pinned from recall); `new` — the searches that came up empty (terms + scopes tried) and a one-line justification why nothing fits
   - **Consumers:** who reads/writes this path today
   - **Projected LOC delta** (`+adds/−removes`), estimated by the researcher

   Prefer the paved road, in order: reuse → extend → lib → new. `new` is the last resort and must prove it. Prefer generic, reusable constructs over per-feature rewrites.
2. **To-be diagram** — write `solution-tobe.puml` next to the spec showing the post-change architecture. Color code: **orange = modified, green = added, red = removed**, with a legend. The diagram must agree with the treeview (same components, same add/modify/remove classification).
3. **Parallel execution plan** — design units grouped into lanes that can be built concurrently: per lane its ordered tasks, its dependencies on other lanes, and merge/checkpoint gates. This section is the input writing-plans uses for task ordering and parallel subagent dispatch.

**2nd-consumer rule:** if a touched path already has ≥1 consumer or writer and this design adds another, the refactor to a shared path is in scope by default — add it to the treeview. If that refactor is medium-large (it would materially grow the arc), surface it instead as a numbered decision (Dn) for the operator to rule on. Any split-brain discovered during research — in scope or not — gets recorded in a **Split-brains found** section of the spec.

**Spec Self-Review:**
After writing the spec document, look at it with fresh eyes:

1. **Placeholder scan:** Any "TBD", "TODO", incomplete sections, or vague requirements? Fix them.
2. **Internal consistency:** Do any sections contradict each other? Does the architecture match the feature descriptions?
3. **Scope check:** Is this focused enough for a single implementation plan, or does it need decomposition?
4. **Ambiguity check:** Could any requirement be interpreted two different ways? If so, pick one and make it explicit.
5. **Required sections:** treeview (paths verified, LOC deltas present), to-be puml (colors consistent with the treeview), parallel execution plan — all present and mutually consistent?
6. **Grounding check:** every treeview entry carries the full evidence contract; every `new` entry shows its empty searches; every 2nd-consumer finding is either in the treeview or a numbered Dn.

Fix any issues inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on.

**User Review Gate:**
After the spec review loop passes, ask the user to review the written spec before proceeding:

> "Spec written and committed to `<path>`. Please review it and let me know if you want to make any changes before we start writing out the implementation plan."

Wait for the user's response. If they request changes, make them and re-run the spec review loop. Only proceed once the user approves.

**Implementation:**

- Invoke the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan
- Do NOT invoke any other skill. writing-plans is the next step.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Inline questions only** - Plain prose in the reply, never the question widget; lettered options in the text welcome
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## Visual Companion

A browser-based companion for showing mockups, diagrams, and visual options during brainstorming. Available as a tool — not a mode. Accepting the companion means it's available for questions that benefit from visual treatment; it does NOT mean every question goes through the browser.

**Offering the companion (just-in-time):** Do NOT offer it upfront. Wait until a question would genuinely be clearer shown than told — a real mockup / layout / diagram question, not merely a UI *topic*. The first time that happens, offer it then, as its own message:
> "This next part might be easier if I show you — I can put together mockups, diagrams, and comparisons in a browser tab as we go. It's still new and can be token-intensive. Want me to? I'll open it for you."

**This offer MUST be its own message.** Only the offer — no clarifying question, summary, or other content. Wait for the user's response. If they accept, start the server with `--open` so their browser opens to the first screen automatically. If they decline, continue text-only and don't offer again unless they raise it.

**Per-question decision:** Even after the user accepts, decide FOR EACH QUESTION whether to use the browser or the terminal. The test: **would the user understand this better by seeing it than reading it?**

- **Use the browser** for content that IS visual — mockups, wireframes, layout comparisons, architecture diagrams, side-by-side visual designs
- **Use the terminal** for content that is text — requirements questions, conceptual choices, tradeoff lists, A/B/C/D text options, scope decisions

A question about a UI topic is not automatically a visual question. "What does personality mean in this context?" is a conceptual question — use the terminal. "Which wizard layout works better?" is a visual question — use the browser.
